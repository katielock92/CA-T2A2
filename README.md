## Planning and Documentation Requirements
### ***R1: Identification of the problem you are trying to solve by building this particular app***
For my API web server application, I am creating a basic Application Tracking System (known as an ATS for short).  An ATS "streamlines the hiring process by automating and organising each step along the way, making it easier to connect with qualified candidates more efficiently."^[1]^

Companies of varying sizes commonly utilise an ATS in their recruitment and hiring practices to support a standardised workflow for recruitment.  This ensures that all applications are kept in a central location and there is consistency in the data collected and stored for roles, candidates and interviews.  Using an ATS also saves hours of administration and manual work, such as copying applications from a job board, or individually emailing rejected candidates.

My API web server application would be the foundation for a simple, low-cost ATS that could provide the key tasks to supporting in hiring, and provide a centralised database of hiring data for richer reporting.

### ***R2: Why is it a problem that needs solving?***
A real-life problem that many small businesses face is that a dedicated ATS is often outside of their budget, and therefore they have to rely on a combination of other cheaper SaaS tools to manage their recruitment processes.  This is something that I personally faced in my current company - at the start of the pandemic we had no ATS, and therefore after applicants applied for roles on our website, different departments followed different processes for the next steps.  The Engineering team utilised a private Trello board per role for short-listed candidates, though this involved needing to have interview notes linked from Google Docs, manually sending calendar invites and communications with candidates, and manually uploading resumes to the Trello board.

Having an ATS, even if a simple one, helps to provide consistency and efficiency in hiring for businesses.  The current economic conditions mean that many businesses are not actively hiring, and often only have open roles if staff leave.  This makes it more difficult, particularly for start-ups, to justify the cost of having an ATS to their management, despite the enormous time saving and rich centralised data that it can provide.

### ***R3: Why have you chosen this database system. What are the drawbacks compared to others?***
